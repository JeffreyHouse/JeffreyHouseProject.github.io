Concerning my Instructions:<br>
Overall, my instructions were fairly accurate. In order to create an easily followable instruction, I made the house as small as possible to reduce the possibility of error. I originally opted for a grid option, in which I would create a grid and just label colors.<br>
There were a couple of distinct errors between my house and the imitation. The sun, which I actually gave every single coordinate for was drawn in the wrong place. The windows, which I stated was 2x2 was also misdrawn, possibly due to skimming the instructions. Furthermore, the tree was drawn at the wrong position despite me giving all 4 coordinates of the base, the imitator opted to only draw 3 of the 4 coordinates in the wrong position. I'm assuming he/she miscounted pixels. The chimney, which I also gave coordinates for was in the wrong position and the wrong color. Although I stated that the imitator should create custom colors just in case, he/she opted to use a different red. The door, which I stated was 1x2 and at the bottom right of the white base of the house was placed at the middle for some reason. Overall, my instructions were accurate, but due to careless reading and miscounting pixels, the imitation had several mistakes.<br><br>

Comparison of English and Processing:<br>
Processing is far more concise than English. While my English instructions can be misread and skimmed, in Processing, because computer languages are designed to understand a syntax in only one way, my instructions cannot be misinterpreted. Computers cannot make human error. In terms of syntax, my color codes were replaced with fill(r,g,b) and my pixels were replaced with rect(x,y,width,height). In terms of conveying ideas, English is superior with its vast vocabulary, but if the end goal is just to convey a set of simple instructions, Processing cannot make mistakes.<br><br>

Comparison of Processing and HTML:<br>
Processing and HTML are both comptuer languages. However, they use different syntax. Procesing is a program designed to create more artistic ideas and HTML is designed to create basic text based webpages. Because they serve different purposes they also have different commands. For example, Processing has the command "rect()" while HTML does not. HTML has more ways of defining text classes and is suited for websites.<br><br>

Comparison of Processing and Paint: <br>
Paint has a much more user friendly interface which is both visually appealing and easy to learn. Processing on the other hand is a text based language that can convert your code into an image. Coding in Processing is more blind because you cannot see what you create as you create it; only by running the code can you see what you have created. However, Processing has the huge advantage of being able to create animations and functioning programs with buttons and whatnot with its various functions.
