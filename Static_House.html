I know it's hard to contain the giggles of excitement elicited by the image directly below this block of text. Rest assured, these feelings are normal and should not be feared. Anyway, this is the original image that I created in Microsoft Paint.

<img src="images/Superior original.png" width="256" height="208" alt="I am sorry to inform you that the droids have failed to deliver the superior original image to you.">

In comparison to the image above, I understand that the image below might come off as a disappointment. However contain your groans, because it actually wasn't too far off. This was the imitation that a classmate created.

<p>These were my instructions </p>

<p align="left">Preparation: <br>
  Make a 16 by 13 canvas.<br>
  Create these custom colors:<br>
  Y = 255, 242, 0<br>
  B = 153, 217, 234<br>
  R = 136, 0, 21<br>
  T = 185, 122, 87<br>
  W = 255, 255, 255<br>
  G = 34, 177, 76z<br>
  (Y = yellow, B = blue, R = red, T = tan, W = white, G = green)<br>
  Just a note, all these colors are in the default palette. But you should create them anyway just in case. <br>
  In order to actually view these pixels more easily, zoom up to 800% and press (Ctrl+G) to turn on the grid. You can view your current position by mousing over any pixel. I tried to make this as small as possible so that it’s easy to copy. Originally, I wanted to just make a grid with color.<br>
  Instructions: <br>
  1.	Fill the background with B. <br>
  2.	Make a one pixel line of G on the bottom. This is the grass. <br>
  3.	Make a 7x5 rectangle of W color. Place it right above the grass, with a one pixel space from the left edge. This is the base of the house.<br>
  4.	Use B to create the two windows. Both windows are 2x2. The left window has a one pixel W border above it and to the left. Make sure that the windows do not touch the sky. The right window is one pixel away from that. For reference, the top left of each window should be (2, 8) and (5,8). <br>
  5.	Use T to create the door, roof, and base of the tree. Your door should be 1x2. It should be on the bottom right of the W base. Next is the roof. The roof has 3 layers of 1 pixel each. The first layer is 9 pixels, the second layer is 7 pixels, and the third layer is 5 layers. Put the third layer on top of the second layer, which should be on top of the first layer. They should stack up to create a stairs effect on both sides. The last use of the T color will be used to create the base of the tree. Just fill in (13, 12), (13, 11), (13, 10), and (13, 9).<br>
  6.	Use R to create the chimney. You only have to create 2 pixels with it, (7, 4) and (7, 5).<br>
  7.	You will have to use the G again to create the actual leaves of the tree. Create a 5x5 green square above the base of the tree. It should be symmetrical. Then use B on the corners. Your leaves should appear to be a very thick green plus sign. If you would prefer to create the leaves using layers similar to the roof, layer 1 is 3 pixels, layer 2 is 5 pixels, layer 3 is 5 pixels, layer 4 is 5 pixels, and layer 5 is 3 pixels.<br>
  8.	The only thing left is the sun. Use Y to fill in coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 2)<br>
  9.	In the end, because the windows are far too small to animate anything, make the canvas size 64x52. Now press (Ctrl+A) to highlight the whole thing. Right click. Choose “Resize”. Resize by percentage. Replace 100 with 400. Keep the “Maintain aspect ratio” checkbox checked. Click “OK”.<br>
